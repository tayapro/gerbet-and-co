The platform includes features such as product filtering, real-time cart updates, Stripe integration, customer account management, and admin-controlled product management.

# Business Model & Marketing

## E-commerce Business Model: Gerbet & Co.

Gerbet & Co. is a small, independent e-commerce business specializing in high-quality French-style macarons and thoughtfully curated tea blends. Rooted in traditional baking techniques and personal craftsmanship, each batch is made in limited quantities with an emphasis on precision, quality, and care.

The shop follows a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model, selling exclusively through its own online platform. This approach allows full control over product quality, packaging, and customer experience. Orders are placed directly through the website and fulfilled from a small-scale production kitchen, with delivery available across Ireland and Europe. Many products are made to order or offered in small seasonal batches to maintain freshness and exclusivity.

## Marketing Strategies

1.  Product-First Storytelling
    Gerbet & Co. emphasizes high-quality ingredients, artisanal techniques, and a meaningful founder story â€” all of which are showcased in the About page. Visual and written content is crafted to create an emotional connection with customers, presenting each order as a joyful, gift-worthy experience.

2.  Visual Social Media Presence
    A Facebook page layout was created for Gerbet & Co to represent the brand online and support future social media engagement strategies.

    <img src="readme/gerbet_and_co_facebook_mockup.png" width="700" alt="gerbet_and_co_facebook_mockup">

3.  Email Marketing with a Personal Touch
    Subscribers receive curated emails including seasonal collection announcements, restock alerts, and macaron-tea pairing ideas. Limited batch drops and early access to new products help create urgency and community around the brand.

4.  Niche Positioning
    Marketing efforts are tailored to specific audiences such as gift buyers, tea enthusiasts, and event planners. Customizable options for weddings, birthdays, and corporate gifts allow Gerbet & Co. to stand out in premium gifting categories.

5.  Local SEO & Community Involvement
    To strengthen local visibility, keywords like "macarons Dublin" and "sweet gist ideas" are used throughout the site. The brand also explores partnerships with local businesses and participates in community events and pop-ups to build grassroots awareness.

6.  Focus on the Gifting Experience
    Every product is packaged with care, using minimal yet elegant design. Optional handwritten notes and curated gift sets are offered, making the experience ideal for occasions like anniversaries, holidays, and thank-you gifts.

## Flowcharts

It provided a clear and accessible way to map out model relationships and plan the database structure effectively.

<img src="readme/gerbetco_flowchart.png" width="700" alt="gerbet flowchart">

## Key Design Decisions

### Imagery

Gerbet & Co embraces a soft and elegant aesthetic, inspired by the charm of artisanal treats and soft elegance.
Product and lifestyle imagery focuses on seasonal macarons, tea moments, and thoughtfully styled packaging
to convey warmth, indulgence, and a handcrafted feel. Each visual was chosen to reflect the calm,
refined nature of the brand.

### Color Scheme

The project applies a refined palette rooted in natural, dessert-inspired tones.
Custom CSS variables define the primary accents:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="readme/zomp.png" width="50" alt="Gerbet & Co color palette" /></td>
        <td>a muted botanical green</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="readme/rose.png" width="50" alt="Gerbet & Co color palette" /></td>
        <td>a delicate blush coral</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="readme/purple.png" width="50" alt="Gerbet & Co color palette" /></td>
        <td>a deep plum with softened opacity</td>
    </tr>
</table>

These colors are used thoughtfully across backgrounds, buttons, and accents to maintain a cohesive,
gentle design throughout the site.

### Typography

Gerbet & Co uses a font pairing that evokes both elegance and readability:

-   **Playfair Display SC** is used for headings, adding a sense of timelessness and quiet sophistication.
-   **Nunito Sans** supports the main body text, ensuring clarity, balance, and a modern finish.

This combination provides a calm, welcoming reading experience while aligning with the brand's
handcrafted and refined identity.

# Agile Methodology

## GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects was utilized to manage this project following Agile principles. While not a dedicated project management platform, it proved effective when paired with labels, issues, and project boards to organize tasks, track progress, and maintain workflow transparency.

The link to the Gerbet & Co board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/tayapro/projects/5).

Using GitHub Projects, user stories, issues, and tasks were organized and tracked weekly via a simple Kanban board. This approach provided clear visibility into progress and allowed for easy updates and adjustments throughout the development process.

<img src="readme/kanban_board.png" width="600" alt="Kanban board">

The **MoSCoW prioritization method** was used alongside custom GitHub project labels to effectively organize tasks. This approach ensured that the most critical features were addressed first, helping to maintain focus and make the best use of the available time.

## Milestones

Milestones were used to group related user stories, helping to structure the development process and maintain focus.

<img src="readme/milestones.png" width="600" alt="milestones">

This approach supported timely delivery by aligning tasks with priorities and deadlines, ensuring that key features were completed in the right order.

## MoSCoW Prioritization

Before implementation began, high-level Epics were broken down into smaller, actionable user stories. This allowed for the application of the MoSCoW prioritization method within the GitHub Issues tab, using custom labels to categorize and manage task importance.

The MoSCoW method was used to group tasks as follows:

-   **Must Have** â€“ Essential features required for the core functionality and successful delivery.
-   **Should Have** â€“ High-value tasks that enhance the product but aren't critical for launch.
-   **Could Have** â€“ Nice-to-have features that provide added value but can be deferred.
-   **Won't Have** â€“ Tasks intentionally excluded from the current development cycle.

This structured approach ensured that key features were delivered first, while still making space for future
enhancements to improve the user experience in later iterations.

<img src="readme/f17_address_book_desktop.png" width="500" alt="f17_address_book_desktop">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="readme/f17_address_book_mobile.png" width="216" alt="f17_address_book_mobile">
</p>

Users can easily:

-   Edit existing addresses to reflect any changes.
-   Delete addresses that are no longer needed.
-   Add New Address to their list to accommodate multiple delivery destinations.

User can designate one address as their default address, which is visually highlighted with a small filled home icon for quick identification. All other addresses display an empty home icon, allowing users to easily set a new default
address with a single click. After updating the default address, the user will see a confirmation message:
"Default shipping address updated."

The default address is automatically pre-filled during checkout but can be changed at any time.

#### CREATE

The Create Address page allows users to add new delivery locations to their personal Address Book. Users can enter essential information such as street address, city, postcode, country, and phone number.<br>
Required fields are clearly marked and enforced with HTML5 validation to ensure data completeness.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f17_address_create_desktop.png" width="500" alt="f17_address_create_desktop">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="readme/f17_address_create_mobile.png" width="216" alt="f17_address_create_mobile">
</p>

Custom validation is also implemented to maintain data quality â€” for example, users are prompted with text like:

-   "Ensure this value has at least 2 characters (it has 1)" for too-short entries,
-   "Enter a valid phone number (7-15 digits, optional '+')" for invalid phone formats.

Additionally, users can set the newly created address as their default shipping address for future orders.

After successful submission, the new address is saved to their Address Book.

#### READ

The READ functionality is implemented on the Address Book page, where users can view all their saved delivery addresses in one convenient place. Each address is clearly displayed with essential details like street name, city, postcode, and country. This setup allows users to easily review their information at a glance and manage their favorite delivery spots.

#### UPDATE

The Update Address page allows users to modify their existing delivery information using a form that mirrors the structure and validation of the Create Address form. Users can update their street address, town or city, postcode, country, and phone number to keep their delivery details accurate and up to date.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f17_address_update_desktop.png" width="500" alt="f17_address_update_desktop">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="readme/f17_address_update_mobile.png" width="216" alt="f17_address_update_mobile">
</p>

Just like in the creation form, users can select the option to set the updated address as their new default shipping address. If selected, it will automatically be prioritized during checkout.

Custom validation is enforced to ensure data consistency:

-   Fields like street address and town or city must have at least 2 characters.
-   Phone numbers must follow a valid format: 7â€“15 digits, with an optional '+' sign.

Upon successful update, users are redirected back to the Address Book page with a Django success message:
"Address updated successfully."

#### DELETE

When a user chooses to delete a saved address from their Address Book, a confirmation modal window appears to ensure the action is intentional.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f17_address_delete.png" width="200" alt="f17_address_delete">
</p>

The modal displays the key details of the address being deleted, providing clarity before proceeding.

The user has two options:

-   Cancel â€” to safely return without making any changes.
-   Delete â€” to permanently remove the selected address.

After confirming the deletion, the address is removed from the user's account, and a Django success message appears:
"Address deleted successfully."

### F18 Deliveries at Door

The Deliveries at Door page allows users to view a summary of their past orders, providing quick access to essential delivery information.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f18_delivery_at_door_desktop.png" width="500" alt="f18_delivery_at_door_desktop">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="readme/f18_delivery_at_door_mobile.png" width="216" alt="f18_delivery_at_door_mobile">
</p>

Each order entry displays:

-   Order number (e.g., #GCO-ORD-YYYYMMDD-#####)
-   Status (e.g., Paid, Failed, etc.)
-   Date of the order
-   Total amount paid

A "View Details" button is available for each order, allowing users to dive deeper into the order's full breakdown.

### F19 Deliveries at Door - Order details page

The Order details page provides a detailed recap of a specific order, offering users a clear and organized summary of their purchase.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f19_order_view_desktop.png" width="500" alt="f19_order_view_desktop">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="readme/f19_order_view_mobile.png" width="216" alt="f19_order_view_mobile">
</p>

The page displays:

-   Order number for easy reference.
-   Delivery address showing where the treats were sent.

Order summary including:

-   Item(s) subtotal
-   Postage & Packing costs
-   Grand total

Items list showing each product purchased, its quantity, and price.

A _Back to Orders_ button ensures seamless navigation back to the full list of deliveries.

### F20 User Access and Logout pages

#### Register page

The page allows new users to create an account by filling out a simple form.
The registration form includes the required fields.

Password creation is guided by built-in Django password validators.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f20_register.png" width="400" alt="f20_register">
</p>

Custom validation is implemented for the first name and last name fields, requiring at least two characters each.
If any input does not meet the criteria, helpful error messages are displayed to guide users.

Upon successful registration, users can immediately log in and begin exploring the site.

#### Login page

The page offers a clean and intuitive form for users to access their accounts securely.
Users are asked to enter their username and password.
For convenience, there are direct links to reset a forgotten password or register for a new account
if the user is not yet a member.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f20_login.png" width="400" alt="f20_login">
</p>

If incorrect credentials are provided, the user will see the following message:
"Please enter a correct username and password. Note that both fields may be case-sensitive."

#### Reset password page

The page offers users a straightforward way to request a password reset if they've forgotten their login credentials.
Users simply need to enter the email address associated with their account and click "Send Password Reset Email." Upon submission, a password reset link will be emailed to them if the email matches an existing account.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f20_reset_password_request.png" width="400" alt="f20_reset_password_request">
</p>

If incorrect or invalid credentials are provided, the user will be informed with the following message:
"Please enter a correct username and password. Note that both fields may be case-sensitive."

#### Password reset sent page

After submitting a password reset request, users are directed to the Password Reset Sent page.
A confirmation message informs users that an email with instructions to reset their password has been
sent to the provided address.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f20_password_reset_sent.png" width="400" alt="f20_password_reset_sent">
</p>

If the email does not arrive shortly, users are advised to:

-   Check their spam or junk folder.
-   Try submitting the reset request again.

This page reassures users that the next steps are in progress and encourages them to monitor their inbox for further instructions.

#### Set new password page

The Set New Password page allows users to securely create a new password after initiating a password reset request.
The form requires the user to enter their new password twice for confirmation, ensuring that both entries match.

Password creation is guided by built-in Django password validation rules.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f20_set_new_password.png" width="400" alt="f20_set_new_password">
</p>

After successfully setting a new password, the user will be redirected to the login page and can log in with their updated credentials.

#### Logout page

The page provides a simple, user-friendly confirmation window asking if you are sure you want to log out.
Users can easily choose between staying logged in ("No" button) or ending their session ("Yes" button).
Upon confirmation, the user is securely logged out of their account and redirected to the homepage and see "
You have been logged out" message.

<p float="left">
<img src="readme/f20_logout.png" width="400" alt="f20_logout">
</p>

### F21 Email Notifications

The application sends automated emails to users at key interaction points to enhance communication and
user experience. The following email types are supported:

-   **Welcome Email** sent to new users after successful registration to greet them and confirm account creation.

    <img src="readme/email_payment_confirmed.png" width="400" alt="email_payment_confirmed">

-   **Subscription Email** sent when a user subscribes to the newsletter, confirming their subscription and welcoming them to the community.

    <img src="readme/email_subscription.png" width="400" alt="email_subscription">

### F22 Spinner

To improve the user experience during the checkout process, a loading spinner was implemented.
It appears when the user submits the payment form and remains visible while awaiting a response from the payment provider.

The spinner activates after the user submits the payment and before the result (success or failure) is returned.

Once the payment is successfully processed, the spinner disappears, and the user is redirected to the order confirmation page.

If the payment fails, the spinner also disappears, and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user without reloading the page.

### F23 Admin Panel / Product Management

The admin panel provides a interface for managing the store's products easily and efficiently.
Administrators can:

-   Update the title, description, price, and category assignments for each product.
-   Quickly select or change product categories using a user-friendly multi-select tool.
-   View the current product image and optionally upload a new image by providing a direct URL.

## Future Features

### Wishlist Functionality

Allow customers to save their favorite macarons, teas into a personal wishlist. This feature would make it easy for users to return and purchase later, while also enabling the option to share their wishlist with friends and family, perfect for gift ideas or special occasions.

### Order Cancellation

Introduce the ability for customers to request a cancellation of their order directly from the 'Deliveries at the Door' section before the order has been processed or shipped. This will offer greater flexibility and control to users, improving overall customer satisfaction and trust.

### Gift Cards

Launch customizable digital gift cards that customers can purchase, personalize with messages, and send electronically. Gift cards would be a thoughtful option for customers who want to share the Gerbet & Co. experience but let recipients choose their own treats.

### Personalized Recommendations

Introduce a smart recommendation engine that suggests products based on a user's browsing habits, purchase history, and wishlist items. This would create a more tailored shopping experience and help customers discover new favorite treats effortlessly.

### Loyalty Program

Create a loyalty rewards system where customers earn points for every purchase, product review, or referral. Points can be redeemed for exclusive discounts, special products, or early access to new collections, encouraging long-term engagement.

### Live Chat Support

Offer a live chat option on the website, allowing customers to quickly get assistance with product inquiries, orders, or account issues. Friendly real-time support would enhance user confidence and provide a more personalized service experience.

# Testing

## Responsivness Testing

The layout has been thoroughly tested and optimized for widely used screen resolutions, based on current usage statistics. Responsive design principles ensure a consistent experience across devices. For smaller or uncommon screen sizes, scroll behavior has been applied where needed to maintain accessibility and prevent layout issues.

## Browser compatibility Testing

Testing has been carried out on the following devices:

Macbook Sanoma Version 14.4.1:

Chrome Version 131.0.6778.265
Firefox Version 134.0.2
Samsung S20:

Chrome Version 132.0.6834.80
iPhone 14:

Safari ios 18.1.1
iPad Air 5th generation:

Safari ios 18.1.1
Windows PC:

Firefox 134.0.2 (Windows 11)
Macbook Pro 2019:

Safari ios 17.6

## User Stories / Features Testing

Feature and user story testing were performed together to ensure a strong alignment between functionality and user expectations. Each feature was verified to support its intended user story, focusing on delivering clear value and a seamless user experience. While individual features and user stories were not listed separately in the final test results spreadsheet, the tests were organized by sections that closely correspond to the implemented features, maintaining logical coverage and clarity.

-   [Test Results Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nvOqcARGIw93b0v3J0wxBqLBeqMvdN1Np24IdLpj3gQ/edit?usp=sharing)

-   [User Stories](https://github.com/tayapro/gerbet-and-co/issues)

## Known Issues

1. OrderItems not created for failed payments

    When a payment attempt fails (e.g., due to a card decline or insufficient funds), the associated OrderItem records are not generated. This behavior prevents incomplete or unpaid orders from affecting the product inventory or order history but may require manual review if troubleshooting failed transactions.

2. Sort & Filter form accepts isolated symbols

    The sort and filter form allows users to submit non-numeric characters such as "+", "-", or "." by themselves in the price range fields. Although these symbols can be submitted, they do not affect the search results or cause any functional issues.

3. `aria-hidden` issue

    ```
    Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be
    hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its
    ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more
    details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification
    at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
