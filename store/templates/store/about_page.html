      “Gerbet” isn't just a name — it's where my story begins.

      They say my relative, Claude Gerbet, was one of the first to create the macaron 
      as we know it today. I grew up with that story — and maybe that's why I've always 
      loved baking them.

    <p class="lead fs-5 text-start gerbet-story-intro-section">
      When I moved to Ireland, I brought that love with me. What started in our little kitchen, 
      with almond flour and a lot of late nights, soon became Gerbet & Co. With Liam by my side, 
      every batch we make is a quiet tribute to the past — and a joyful gift to the present.

        Gerbet & Co. began in my cozy Irish kitchen, miles away from the sunlit streets 
        of France where I first fell in love with baking. Macarons were always my 
        favorite — delicate, colorful, and full of joy. What started as a way to 
        bring a little sweetness to my new home quickly turned into something bigger.

      <p class="gerbet-story-team-text mb-0">
        It all started with her macarons. I still remember the first bite — light as air, 
        perfectly sweet, and unlike anything I'd ever tasted. She brought her passion for 
        French baking to our little kitchen in Ireland, and from the very beginning, 
        I knew it was something special.
